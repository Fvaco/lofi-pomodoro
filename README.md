# üçÖ Lofi Pomodoro timer ‚è≤Ô∏è
This Lofi Pomodoro Timer is ideal for using the Pomodoro Technique to study and work. The timer will stop automatically with each break, that'll help you to create a stronger study inertia and habit.

It's available in https://lofi-pomodoro.vercel.app/, feel free to use it and give me some feedback!
